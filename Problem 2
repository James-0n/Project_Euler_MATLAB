% Parameterize the array, array index i, and the sum tracker.

A(1)=1;

A(2)=2;

result=2;

i=3;

while A < 4000000 % While Fibonacci sequence (A) value does not exceed four million

A(i)=A(i-1)+A(i-2); % The ith value of the array is equivalent to the sum of
                    % the prior two values
    if mod(A(i),2)==0      % If this value is divisible by 2
       result=result+A(i); % add it to the sum.
    end
    
i=i+1; % Continue to define the next array element

end

disp(result)
