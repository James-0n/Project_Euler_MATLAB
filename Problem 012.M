% Question: The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. 
% What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
%
% Answer: 76576500
% Runtime: 4.373894 seconds
% Commentary: This is the first Project Euler problem that requires significant computation, so our sqrt time save check for factors
%             is crucial (without it, runtime exceeds ten minutes!).
