# Project_Euler_MATLAB
All runtimes are measured using MATLAB's built in stopwatch timer (tic and toc functions). Code will be written so that it is easily adaptable to a similar problem with different parameters. I will generally code my own functions over using MATLAB's built-ins; exceptions include mundane functions that keep the code clean like 'length()'. 

Problems that I think are cool: 005, 010, 014, 015
